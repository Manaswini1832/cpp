Followed [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLnPwxZdW4Y) video

## New things I'm picking up after the video

- Name of the array is a pointer to the first element in the array
  cout << myArray; -> Will print the address of the first element of myArray
  cout << \*myArray; -> Will print the first element of myArray
  \*myArray + 1  -> This will add 1 to the first element of myArray
  \*(myArray + 1) -> This will give the second element of myArray
